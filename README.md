# 🧠 Data Mining Projects

This repository includes two mini-projects focused on data mining tasks using real-world datasets. The goal of these projects is to practice and demonstrate techniques such as data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling using R.

## 📌 Project 1: Digikala Order Prediction

**Objective:**  
To analyze customer order data from Digikala (a major Iranian e-commerce platform) and build predictive models for estimating the total value of future orders.

**Key Steps:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization of customer behavior and order patterns
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Building regression models to predict future order amounts

**Files:**
- 📁 `R data mining/`: Contains the dataset, R scripts, and a PDF report explaining the methodology, results, and conclusions.

## 📌 Project 2: Income Decile Classification (Iran)

**Objective:**  
To classify individuals into income deciles based on selected features, using a small-scale dataset representing a sample of the Iranian population.

**Key Steps:**
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Training classification models to predict income levels
- Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix

**Files:**
- 📁 `hazineh-daramad/`: Contains the final report in PDF format
- Source code is available directly in the repository for transparency and reproducibility
